   <h3>Woodwork</h3>
   <p>Woodwork is a growing passion, from the first tentative chisel cuts, to the dovetails and dados.
   <h3>Coding</h3>
   <p>Coding is how just about everything works in today's society. Some knowledge may well go a long way. </p>

   <h2>Building with Wood. Building with Code.</h2>

    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I'm Danton, life-long learner. My kids get to learn this stuff at school, I've always wanted to learn this stuff, so I am teaching myself!</p>
   <p>I've been inspired by YouTube bloggers such as SeeJaneDrill and April Wilkerson, and films such as "Hidden Figures", and as such have set out to learn what I can about woodwork and coding, two topics I have wished to learn for a long time but not had the time or resources to do so. I still don't have much time, and resources are low, however with the help of Youtube, Code Academy and Khan Academy, progress is being made, slowly!</p>
   <p>It can be frustrating at times, when things are not going correctly, or when I have to start again, however I keep reminding myself that it is not easy teaching onself, and I learn from my mistakes.</p>
   <p>This journey keeps me inspired in all other parts of my life: building my family, my health, my fitness, my other interests. They can all be done. Well.</p>
